This is the summary of our game. I wrote this once already and github deleted it on accident, so it's not going to be as complete.

It will be released in 4 cycles, each cycle introduces new gameplay mechanics, as well as a new story, each taking place 100 years from the next. The main character is an immortal who is forced into a war every cycle against his will.

Cycle 1 will focus on magic, all characters will be able to use magic of some kind.
Cycle 2 will focus on variable weapons, rather than many different kinds of magic, there will be different kinds of weapons. More on that when we get there.
Cycle 3 will focus on stealth and long range weapons. Not, sneak up on someone and stab they dead kind of stealth, but it will be more advantageous to the player to get in close before the enemies see them than to charge right in like many do in Fire Emblem.
Cycle 4 will have mechs, varying the way each member of the player's team will be able to fight completely.

There will be three endings to the game, based on how many descendents remain in the last cycle. (more on descendents in the characters page) Ending 1 is with the main character being the only one left in the last cycle, giving an in-game challenge run to solo the entire last part of the game. Ending 2 is with some descendents with him. The true ending is gotten only if the other 2 immortal descendents are gotten (One in cycle 2 and one in cycle 3).

Now friggin don't delete my file this time, github...
